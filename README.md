# Diwali_Sales_Analysis(Exploratory_Data_Analysis)
The Diwali Sales Analysis Project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project with the objective of learning essential insights about shopping patterns during the Diwali festival. In this project, by using Python and key data analysis libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy we have visualized and analyzed the data. The main goal is to interpret the purchasing habits of various demographic groups, including gender, age group, Indian states, and marital status.
